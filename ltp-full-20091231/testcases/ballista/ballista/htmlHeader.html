<P><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica"> Listed below are the functions
tested the last time Ballista OS Test was run. In addition to the basic result
information, a link is provided for each function to a csh script. When
executed, the csh script will generate C++ code that reproduces the robustness
errors encountered for the selected function. One c++ file is created for each
robustness error encountered.  </FONT></P>

<P>There are two basic ways to use the script information</P>

<OL>
<LI> Find the test case you are interested in within the script and copy that
single command to the command line </LI>

<UL>
<LI> The command should be performed after you are in the /outfiles directory. 
</LI>
<LI> The output will be placed in the directory and file specified at the end
of the command. </LI>
<LI> For example for the access function with parameters set to
b_ptr_buf=BUF_LARGE and b_short_int_common=ZERO: (all on one line)
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="AAD5D5"><FONT SIZE="-1"> .../ballista/outfiles&gt;
<B><STRONG>./create_code_standAlone.pl access Abort 2 b_ptr_buf BUF_LARGE
b_short_int_common ZERO &gt;
access_bug_report/access.b_ptr_bufBUF_LARGE.b_short_int_commonZERO.cpp
</STRONG></B></FONT></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
</UL>


<LI> The other option will be to run the entire script and create all the
programs with a single command </LI>

<UL>
<LI> The script is already saved as a file. The file is stored as
/outfiles/<I>functionName</I>_bug_report/genCode.</LI>
<LI> Executing this script may create thousands of c++ files depending on the
number of robustness errors detected. </LI>
<LI> For example for the access function <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="AAD5D5"><FONT
SIZE="-1"> .../ballista/outfiles/access_bug_report&gt; <B>genCode</B>
</FONT></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
