he ballista test suite is designed to provide numerous combinations of
erroneous input parameters to system calls.  It can be built by issuing
the make command in the ballista directory, however can also be built
by giving the make command in the top LTP directory (recommended)

The command to run ballista issue the following command:

        runltp -f ballista


OR

     you can go into the /root/ltp/testcases/ballista/ballista
     directory and run

        perl ostest_new.pl #


The value of '#' should be between the values of 1 and 100.  This is the
percentage of test combinations you will run for each system call. By default in the /runtest/ballista file the value is 100.


The results will be placed in an outfile directory.  You can view the
results in an os_results.txt file or in a html document called index.html.
