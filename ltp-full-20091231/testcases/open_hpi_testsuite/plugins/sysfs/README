In order to use this plugin, you must have a machine with libsysfs version
0.3.0* installed (found in sysutils 0.3.0).  Follow the instructions to install.

To install this code:
  make
  make install (as root)

Can be verified using program examples/list_resources and examples/set_resources

-----------------------
Developer note:
- If you'd like to test for an imaginary system with more entities, you can
point to an imaginary sysfs file system:

 * create a mounts file (like /proc/mounts) that has only one entry pointing
   to your imaginary sysfs file system
 * change include/libsysfs.h to point to your mounts file (SYSFS_PROC_MNTS)
 * in lib/ run "make" and "make install"
 * libsysfs should now be looking at your imaginary file system for sysfs
   entries
