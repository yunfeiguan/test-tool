    <para>
      OpenHPI is an open source project created with the intent of providing
      an implementation of the Service Availability Forum's Hardware Platform 
      Interface (HPI).  HPI provides a universal interface for creating resource 
      system models, typically for chassis and rack based servers, but extendable 
      for other problem domains such as clustering, virtualization and simulation.

      <title>Document Scope</title>
      <para>
        This manual covers the entire breadth of the OpenHPI project.
        This includes, but is not limited to, and overview of the SAF
        HPI, OpenHPI internal design, OpenHPI plugin interfaces,
        OpenHPI configuration, and OpenHPI usage scenarios.  It is a
        living document, and as such will evolve along with the
        OpenHPI project itself.
