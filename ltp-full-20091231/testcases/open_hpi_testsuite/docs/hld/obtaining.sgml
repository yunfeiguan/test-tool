      <title>Installing OpenHPI</title>
      <para>
	The quickest way to get going with OpenHPI would be to install
	the binary RPMs.  Simply by doing:
     <programlisting role="command">
	bash$ rpm -Uvh openhpi-0.x-x.i386.rpm
     </programlisting>
      </para>
	<para>
	However, you can also install by compiling the source from the tar archive.
	Please read the README file included in the source for dependencies and
	required libraries and packages.
	</para>
	<para>
	Having all dependencies satisfied, simply:
	<programlisting role="bash">
	bash$ tar -zvxf openhpi-0.x.tar.gz
	bash$ cd openhpi-0.x
	bash$ ./configure 
	(you can pass many flags here, ./configure --help will list them)
	bash$ make
	bash$ make install
	bash$ mkdir -p /etc/openhpi
	bash$ cp examples/openhpi.conf.example /etc/openhpi/openhpi.con
	</programlisting>
	</para>
	</sect1>

	<title>Configuring OpenHpi</title>
	<para>
	If you installed the RPMs, then the configuration file <literal>
	/etc/openhpi/openhpi.conf</literal> will be installed.  If you installed
	from the source using <literal>make install</literal> then you should
	have copied the file manually by now.
	</para>
	<para>
	Edit the <literal>/etc/openhpi.conf</literal> file to enable and configure
	the plug-in you intend to use.  See the OpenHpi Manual section<link linkend="plugin-usage">
	OpenHpi Plug-in Usage</link> for more info.
